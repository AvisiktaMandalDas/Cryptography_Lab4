# Cryptography_Lab4
This lab provides a simple Python implementation to demonstrate how message authentication can be performed using the MD5 hash algorithm. The idea behind this program is to ensure message integrity — verifying that a message has not been tampered with during transmission. The sender generates an MD5 hash of the original message, which acts as a digital signature, and sends both the message and its signature to the receiver. Upon receiving the data, the receiver computes the MD5 hash of the received message and compares it with the provided signature. If both hashes match, it confirms that the message is authentic and has not been altered; otherwise, it indicates that the message may have been modified or corrupted.

The implementation uses Python’s built-in hashlib library, which provides a simple interface for generating hash digests. The lab contains functions to create the hash signature (generate_md5_signature) and to verify message authenticity (verify_signature). The code includes example scenarios where the verification succeeds for the original message and fails for a tampered one, helping users understand how hashing contributes to data integrity verification.

While this example effectively demonstrates the concept of signature-based authentication, it is important to note that MD5 is considered cryptographically insecure due to vulnerabilities that allow hash collisions. In real-world security systems, stronger algorithms such as SHA-256, SHA-3, or HMAC-based methods are recommended for ensuring secure and tamper-proof authentication.
